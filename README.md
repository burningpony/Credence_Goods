# Credence Goods

An application to support the collection of data for economics studies.

### Dependencies

- docker
- docker-compose

### Getting it Running Locally

Start a bash console inside of the dev environment.

1. `$ docker-compose up -d db redis`

(Ensure you do not have a local postgres running on the same port)

2. `$ bin/setup`

3. `$ rails s`

### Working within the project

#### Pulling down others work

    $ git pull

#### Running Tests

In the container

    $ bin/rake

## Application description

Project Updates Credence Goods. Initial documentation..

Current Flow of Experiment:

(Configurations / set up in admin)
Navigate to root and type in group name associated with experiment.
Instructions

Test Functions

Part 1

Quiz 2

Matching Partners Screen (wait until match)

### Part 2
(Repeat until out of rounds in group)

Expert 

- Makes predictions on groups function sets

Customer

- Watches matched Expert make estimations

Payment Screen

Payment Calculations

Cost of Coordinate = 0.30

Cost of Point = 0.25

### Part 1:

Starting Cash (hard coded to 30) - the accuracy of point predictions (diff max value and prediction) - price of requested sample points - price of requested basis lines.

Should we be enforcing that all functions are answered in part 1?

### Part 2:

Expert:

#### FFS:

-The groups configured ffs payment * (number of bought payment requests + number of bought sample points) + number of function predictions _ group ffs payment _ 3

-Prediction payment for ffs is currently estimated as group ffs payment _ 3 is that okay?

#### Salary:
-The groups configured Salary amount
Capitation:
-The groups configured capitation payment \* number of unique function_sets the expert made predictions on

#### Customer:
Starting Cash (hard coded to 30) - the accuracy of point predictions by each expert by round (diff max value and prediction) - price of requested sample points - price of requested basis lines

Total Payment: Part 1 payment + Part 2 payment

#### Notes:

-Points no longer collide, if a requested point lands within 1/50th of the ranges of the function a new point will be requested in the next range.

-We do have an automated test that ensures that two users can pair and move through the entire experiment.

-We do not plan on generating the functions programmatically, we do plan on providing a function playground view to help construct functions, let us know if this will be enough for you guys.

-Notes on accuracy mechanism below.

#### TODO:

-Payments Calculations seem to be a little bit bugged

-Running through the experiment, to ensure it is behaving as we expect, giving it more of a stress test to ensure that the experiment will run in larger groups as best as we can. Ensuring indexes and querying can handle larger groups as well.

-Images for quizzes, we will be generating images for the quizzes and setting the correct answers as best as we can.

-Function playground: This is to help us with image generating, but our expectation is that this playground may help with the construction of functions to be used in the experiment as well.

-Re enable Heroku hosting to credence goods app. Will forward www route along once determined.

-Some payment tweaks (subtract expenses for part 1)

#### Routes

All routes are protected by basic http auth. User: user Password: 123456789.

/
Route to experiment interface, Presents input to select which group the participant will be a member of (uses named group from admin interface

##### /admin*

Experimenter dashboard for viewing recently finished users. Shows payment with by recently finished users.

##### /admin/comments

Placeholder (not really used)

##### /admin/function_responses
Table containing all function responses. A function response is how we store a userâ€™s answer to a graph, for both parts 1 and
2. CSV export

##### /admin/function_set*
This is referred to as a group inside of the experiment documentation. Function set attaches a set of functions to a group. This is where function sets for groups are managed.

##### /admin/functions*
Functions that will be graphed. Must be attached to a function set. Has a String representation of the function, then function bounds. Bounds specify where the GSS function will find value, also bounds of graph.

##### /admin/groups*
Admin view for creating groups default payment of the group specifies how experts will be paid in part 2. Can specify payment details, as well as number of rounds.

##### /admin/quiz_responses
Stores user responses to the quizzes

##### /admin/user_pairs

##### User pairs for part 2. (How experimenter is matched with a customer)
/users
User view

Users should really be thought of as participants.. poorly named
\*Starred routes are used by experiment runners. Admin routes contain xml and csv exports.

## Configuration Details
Configuration occurs underneath the /admin route.

#### Groups

`/admin/groups`
Groups specifies the nature of the experiment. 

**Name:** Name of the group used for accessing the group

**Payment Method:** Capitation, FFS, or Salary.

**Salary Payment:** Amount of salary paid if salary payment method.

**Capitation Payment:** Amount of capitation paid if capitation payment method

**FFS Payment:** Amount of FFS paid if FFs is selected

#### Function Set

`/admin/function_sets`

After a group is created a functionset can be created, a function set is a collection of functions to be grouped together. These sets will be grouped together as the participant answers the questions. Function sets are attached to a group.

**Group:** Group function set will be associated with.

#### Functions

**Function Set:** Function set the function will be attached to.

**String Representation of Function:** Math.js representation of the function. https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/parsing.html

**Bounds** Bounds that will limit range of function for predictions / graphing. 

## Results Details

#### Dashboard

`/admin/dashboard`
Orders recently finished participants and displays how much they should be paid.
